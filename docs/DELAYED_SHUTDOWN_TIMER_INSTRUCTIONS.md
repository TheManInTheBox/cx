# Delayed Shutdown Timer Instructions - TESTING COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Overview
This document provides guidance on implementing shutdown timer patterns in CX Language applications. CX Language now supports both **automatic system shutdown timers** (built-in) and **manual delayed shutdown patterns** for custom use cases.

### ‚úÖ Implementation Status: PRODUCTION READY (July 25, 2025)
The AutoShutdownTimerService has been successfully implemented, tested, and verified working in production. All timer functionality is operational and ready for use.

**Verified Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ **AutoShutdownTimerService initialization**: Service properly instantiated in CLI
- ‚úÖ **30-second default timer**: Automatic countdown starts on system.start
- ‚úÖ **Timer extension functionality**: 10-second extension applied successfully 
- ‚úÖ **Event emission system**: All timer events properly emitted and handled
- ‚úÖ **Graceful shutdown**: System.shutdown triggered automatically after timer elapsed
- ‚úÖ **Service cleanup**: Proper disposal and resource cleanup on shutdown
- ‚úÖ **Real-time demonstration**: Complete demo shows full timer lifecycle

## üî• **NEW: Automatic System Shutdown Timer**

CX Language now includes an **AutoShutdownTimerService** that automatically shuts down applications after a configurable delay. This ensures all applications terminate gracefully without manual intervention.

### Features
- **Default 30-second timer**: All applications automatically shutdown after 30 seconds
- **Configurable delay**: Can be customized per application needs
- **Event-driven**: Emits events for timer start, extension, cancellation, and completion
- **Graceful shutdown**: Properly disposes all services and resources
- **Override capability**: Applications can cancel or extend the timer as needed

### Timer Events

The auto shutdown timer emits several events for consciousness-aware applications:

```cx
// Timer started when system.start is emitted
on timer.shutdown.started (event)
{
    print("‚è∞ Auto shutdown timer started");
    print("üïí Estimated shutdown in: " + event.delaySeconds + " seconds");
}

// Timer elapsed - system shutdown initiated
on timer.shutdown.elapsed (event)
{
    print("‚è±Ô∏è Auto shutdown timer elapsed");
    print("üõë System shutdown initiated automatically");
}

// Timer was cancelled by application
on timer.shutdown.cancelled (event)
{
    print("‚ùå Auto shutdown timer cancelled");
}

// Timer was extended
on timer.shutdown.extended (event)
{
    print("‚è∞ Auto shutdown timer extended by: " + event.additionalSeconds + " seconds");
}
```

### Controlling the Auto Timer

Applications can control the automatic shutdown timer through events:

```cx
// Cancel the auto shutdown timer
emit timer.shutdown.cancel { reason: "user_interaction_detected" };

// Extend the timer by additional time
emit timer.shutdown.extend { additionalMs: 15000 }; // Add 15 more seconds
```

## Manual Delayed Shutdown Pattern

For applications that need custom shutdown timing logic, you can still implement manual delayed shutdown patterns:

## Manual Delayed Shutdown Pattern

For applications that need custom shutdown timing logic, you can still implement manual delayed shutdown patterns:

### 1. Create a Delayed Shutdown Timer

Use the `await` cognitive function with the following pattern:

```cx
// Add a 5-second delayed system shutdown timer
await { 
    reason: "graceful_shutdown",
    context: "Allowing time to observe final results before shutdown",
    minDurationMs: 5000,    // Fixed 5-second delay
    maxDurationMs: 5000,    // Same as min for consistent timing
    handlers: [ system.shutdown.timer.complete ]
};
```

### 2. Implement the Timer Completion Handler

Add an event handler for when the timer completes:

```cx
on system.shutdown.timer.complete (event)
{
    print("‚è±Ô∏è 5-second observation period complete");
    print("üõë Initiating graceful system shutdown");
    emit system.shutdown { reason: "demo_complete" };
}
```

### 3. Add a Global System Shutdown Handler

Implement a handler for processing the system shutdown event:

```cx
// Global system shutdown handler
on system.shutdown (event)
{
    print("üî¥ SYSTEM SHUTDOWN INITIATED");
    print("üìã Shutdown reason: " + event.reason);
    print("‚è±Ô∏è Total runtime: " + new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
    print("üåü Thank you for experiencing the application");
}
```

## Best Practices

### Automatic Timer Best Practices
1. **Default Behavior**: The 30-second auto timer is suitable for most demos and short-running applications
2. **Cancel When Needed**: Cancel the timer if your application needs to run indefinitely (`emit timer.shutdown.cancel`)
3. **Extend for Long Operations**: Extend the timer when performing longer operations (`emit timer.shutdown.extend`)
4. **Monitor Timer Events**: Listen to timer events for consciousness-aware behavior
5. **Graceful Handling**: The auto timer ensures clean shutdown even if applications forget to emit `system.shutdown`

### Manual Timer Best Practices
1. **Consistent Timing**: Use identical values for `minDurationMs` and `maxDurationMs` when you need a precise delay.
2. **Informative Messages**: Print clear shutdown messages to inform users about the application state.
3. **Include Reason**: Always include a `reason` parameter in your `system.shutdown` event to track shutdown causes.
4. **Clean Termination**: The `system.shutdown` event provides clean application termination without forcing process kills.
5. **User Experience**: Manual delays allow users to read final output before application closes.
6. **Event-Driven Pattern**: Follow the event-driven approach using handlers rather than direct delays.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Example
```cx
on task.complete (event)
{
    print("Task completed successfully!");
    
    await { 
        reason: "graceful_shutdown",
        context: "Task completion shutdown",
        minDurationMs: 5000,
        maxDurationMs: 5000,
        handlers: [ system.shutdown.timer.complete ]
    };
}
```

### Example with Dynamic Timing
```cx
on process.complete (event)
{
    print("Process completed with results: " + event.results);
    
    // Dynamic timing based on result complexity
    var shutdownDelay = event.complexity * 1000; // 1 second per complexity unit
    shutdownDelay = Math.min(shutdownDelay, 10000); // Cap at 10 seconds
    shutdownDelay = Math.max(shutdownDelay, 3000); // Minimum 3 seconds
    
    await { 
        reason: "process_complete_shutdown",
        context: "Allowing time to review process results",
        minDurationMs: shutdownDelay,
        maxDurationMs: shutdownDelay,
        handlers: [ system.shutdown.timer.complete ]
    };
}
```

## Integration with MultidisciplinaryStreamAgent

The MultidisciplinaryStreamAgent example demonstrates proper implementation of this pattern:

1. Triggers the timer at the end of the demonstration
2. Uses precise 5000ms timing for consistent behavior
3. Provides clear shutdown messages with proper context
4. Handles cleanup through the event system
5. Shows global system shutdown handling

This pattern should be considered a standard practice for all CX Language applications that need to perform cleanup and graceful termination after completing their primary functions.
