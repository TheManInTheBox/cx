## 🔬 What You'll See

### Measurement Output
Each demo will show real-time neuroplasticity measurements including:
- **Strength Changes**: Synaptic connection strength modifications
- **Plasticity Types**: LTP, LTD, STDP detection
- **Biological Timing**: Adherence to neural timing windows
- **Authenticity Scores**: How closely the system follows biological patterns

### Key Metrics
- **Total Connections**: Number of tracked synaptic connections
- **Active Connections**: Currently active neural pathways

## 🔧 System Requirements

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9 Runtime
- CX Language Runtime with neuroplasticity extensions
- Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
- Memory: At least 4GB RAM recommended
- Storage: 100MB free space for temporary measurement data

### Dependencies
The neuroplasticity demos require these CX services:
- `measureNeuroplasticity` - Core measurement service
- `analyzeNeuroplasticity` - Analysis and reporting service
- `optimizePlasticity` - Optimization service
- `adapt` - Consciousness adaptation pattern
- Standard CX consciousness patterns (`is`, `not`, `realize`, `learn`)

### Configuration
No additional configuration required. The demos use default neuroplasticity parameters:
- Measurement window: 5 minutes
- Biological timing precision: ±0.1ms
- Synaptic strength range: 0-10
- Default optimization strategy: "balanced"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Service not found" errors
Ensure the CX runtime includes the neuroplasticity extensions:
```bash
dotnet build src/CxLanguage.Runtime/CxLanguage.Runtime.csproj
```

#### Low biological authenticity scores
This is normal for initial measurements. The system will automatically optimize if scores are below 0.8.

#### Memory usage warnings
The neuroplasticity system maintains measurement history. For long-running demos, this is expected behavior.

### Performance Tips
- Run demos individually for best performance
- Allow 1-2 seconds between measurements for accurate timing
- Monitor memory usage during extended demonstrations

## 📊 Interpreting Results

### Biological Authenticity Scores
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent biological fidelity
- **0.8-0.9**: Good biological authenticity  
- **0.7-0.8**: Acceptable with room for improvement
- **0.6-0.7**: Needs optimization
- **<0.6**: Requires significant optimization

### Plasticity Types
- **LTP**: Healthy learning and strengthening
- **LTD**: Normal synaptic pruning and optimization
- **STPCausal**: Precise timing-dependent learning
- **None**: No significant plasticity detected

### Learning Efficiency
- **>0.8**: Excellent adaptive learning
- **0.6-0.8**: Good learning capability
- **0.4-0.6**: Moderate learning efficiency
- **<0.4**: Learning optimization needed

## 🚀 Next Steps

After running the demos, explore:
1. **Custom Measurements**: Modify timing parameters and stimulus strengths
2. **Integration**: Add neuroplasticity measurement to your own CX programs
3. **Optimization**: Experiment with different optimization strategies
4. **Analysis**: Create custom analysis and reporting patterns
5. **Research**: Use the system for consciousness computing research
