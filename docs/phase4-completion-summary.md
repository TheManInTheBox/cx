**Azure OpenAI Integration:** âœ… CONFIGURED  

## Summary

Phase 4 of the CX Language has been successfully completed with all 7 core AI functions fully implemented and tested. The language now supports AI-native programming with seamless integration between traditional programming constructs and AI operations.

## Implemented AI Functions

### 1. `task(prompt)` - Task Planning and Execution
- **Purpose:** AI-driven task planning and autonomous execution
- **Implementation:** Integrated with Azure OpenAI for intelligent task breakdown
- **Example:** `var plan = task("Create a plan for implementing a binary search tree");`

### 2. `reason(prompt)` - Logical Reasoning
- **Purpose:** AI-powered logical reasoning and problem analysis
- **Implementation:** Uses AI models for complex reasoning tasks
- **Example:** `var analysis = reason("What are the advantages of functional programming?");`

### 3. `synthesize(prompt)` - Code Generation
- **Purpose:** AI-assisted code generation and synthesis
- **Implementation:** Generates code based on natural language specifications
- **Example:** `var code = synthesize("Generate a merge sort algorithm in JavaScript");`

### 4. `process(input, context)` - Multi-modal Processing
- **Purpose:** Process and analyze multi-modal inputs (text, images, audio)
- **Implementation:** Handles complex data processing with contextual awareness
- **Example:** `var result = process("Analyze this code quality", "JavaScript function with nested loops");`

### 5. `generate(prompt)` - Content Generation
- **Purpose:** Creative content generation and text production
- **Implementation:** Leverages AI for creative writing and content creation
- **Example:** `var article = generate("Write a technical blog post about microservices");`

### 6. `embed(text)` - Vector Embeddings
- **Purpose:** Convert text to semantic embeddings for similarity search
- **Implementation:** Creates high-dimensional vector representations
- **Example:** `var embedding = embed("Convert this text to semantic embeddings");`

### 7. `adapt(code)` - Self-optimization
- **Purpose:** AI-driven code optimization and self-improvement
- **Implementation:** Analyzes and improves code performance automatically
- **Example:** `var optimized = adapt("function slowSort(arr) { return arr.sort(); }");`

## Technical Implementation

### Azure OpenAI Integration
- **Service:** AzureOpenAIService with API key authentication
- **Configuration:** Both configuration file and hardcoded fallback support
- **HTTP Client:** Direct HTTP calls to Azure OpenAI API for maximum compatibility
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with mock fallbacks

### Compiler Integration
- **Two-pass Compilation:** AI functions integrated into the two-pass compilation system
- **IL Code Generation:** Each AI function generates proper .NET IL code
- **Service Injection:** AI functions use dependency injection for service access
- **Type Safety:** Proper type handling and stack management

switch (aiCall.FunctionName.ToLower())
{
    case "task": return CompileTaskFunction(aiCall);
    case "reason": return CompileReasonFunction(aiCall);
    case "synthesize": return CompileSynthesizeFunction(aiCall);
    case "process": return CompileProcessFunction(aiCall);
    case "generate": return CompileGenerateFunction(aiCall);
    case "embed": return CompileEmbedFunction(aiCall);
    case "adapt": return CompileAdaptFunction(aiCall);
}
```

### Service Integration
