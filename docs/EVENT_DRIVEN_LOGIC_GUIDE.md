# CX Language - Pure Event-Driven Logic Patterns

## 🔄 Pure Event Routing (No Conditional Keywords)

### **Event-Based Decision Pattern**
```cx
# Pure event routing for decision logic
emit performance.check {
    biologicalAuthenticity: event.biologicalAuthenticity,
    threshold: 0.8,
    handlers: [performance.evaluate]
};

on performance.evaluate(event: object) {
    emit performance.high.action {
        score: event.biologicalAuthenticity,
        handlers: [performance.high.handler]
    };
}

on performance.high.handler(event: object) {
    print("✅ Excellent biological neural authenticity!");
    
    # Continue with high performance logic
    measureNeuroplasticity {
        data: { enhancedMode: true },
        handlers: [ enhanced.measurement.complete ]
    };
}
```

### **Multiple Decision Paths - Event Routing**
```cx
# Route to different handlers based on performance
emit performance.evaluation {
    score: event.biologicalAuthenticity,
    handlers: [ performance.routing ]
};

# Handle in separate event handlers
on performance.routing(event: object) {
    emit performance.excellent.check {
        score: event.score,
        handlers: [performance.excellent.action]
    };
    
    emit performance.optimization.check {
        score: event.score,
        handlers: [performance.optimization.action]
    };
}

on performance.excellent.action(event: object) {
    print("🏆 EXCELLENT Performance!");
    # Handle excellent case with dedicated logic
    emit enhancement.activate {
        mode: "excellence",
        score: event.score
    };
}

on performance.optimization.action(event: object) {
    print("⚠️ Needs optimization");
    # Handle optimization case with dedicated logic
    emit optimization.activate {
        mode: "improvement",
        score: event.score
    };
}
```

## ✅ Benefits of Pure Event-Driven Logic

- **Zero Conditional Keywords**: No `when`, `is`, `not`, or `maybe` needed
- **Cleaner Syntax**: Pure event emission and dedicated handlers
- **Better Debugging**: Each decision path has a named, dedicated handler
- **Consciousness Native**: Events naturally model consciousness flow
- **Cleaner Code**: Direct condition + action pattern
- **Event-Driven**: Maintains pure event architecture philosophy
- **Better Performance**: Less cognitive overhead during execution
- **Easier to Read**: Straightforward conditional logic

## 🎯 Migration Pattern

**Old (Eliminated):**
```cx
is {
    condition: value > threshold,
    reasoning: "Check if value exceeds threshold for processing",
    context: "Performance evaluation in consciousness system"
} {
    # action
}
```

**New (Simplified):**
```cx
when {
    condition: value > threshold,
    action: "process_high_value"
} {
    # action
}
```

**Even Better (Pure Event):**
```cx
emit value.evaluation { 
    value: value, 
    threshold: threshold,
    handlers: [ value.processing ]
};
```
