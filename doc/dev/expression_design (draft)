Cx expressions design document

[07-30-2013] Ideas for expressions design
The initial design of Cx expressions works well with basic types (int, bool, char).
However, the current design does not take in to account I/O streams. In this 
document I/O stream support for expressions will be pondered.

Making expressions stream aware will provide simpler string and I/O operations 
to the user.
