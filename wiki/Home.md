# Cx Language Wiki

Welcome to the **Cx (Cognitive Executor)** language wiki - your comprehensive guide to autonomous programming with AI-native development.

## üé≠ **FEATURED: Multi-Agent Voice Debate Demo**

**üåü [Premier Multi-Agent Voice Debate Demo](Premier-Multi-Agent-Voice-Debate-Demo.md) - The Ultimate CX Demonstration**

Three autonomous AI agents with distinct voice personalities debating climate change:
- **Dr. Green**: Authoritative-scientific voice, fast-paced, urgent tone
- **Prof. Smith**: Calm-analytical voice, measured-slow, contemplative tone  
- **Maya**: Youthful-energetic voice, medium-paced, passionate tone

**Revolutionary features demonstrated**: Multi-agent coordination, voice personality system, speech synthesis integration, complex service injection, and structured turn-based interaction.

## üß† What is Cx?

Cx is an autonomous programming language built on the **Aura cognitive architecture framework**, featuring JavaScript/TypeScript-like syntax on .NET 8 with IL code generation. **Phase 4 (AI Integration) is 100% COMPLETE** with 6 operational AI services and production-ready vector database integration.

### Core Philosophy: Autonomous AI-First Development
- **AI-Native Design**: Every language feature designed for autonomous AI workflows  
- **Agentic Programming**: Code that reasons, adapts, and self-modifies based on runtime feedback
- **Cognitive Architecture**: Built around the SEIDR loop: Synthesize, Execute, Instruct, Debug, Repair
- **Semantic Intelligence**: First-class support for embeddings, vector databases, and RAG workflows

## üöÄ Quick Examples

### Event-Driven Autonomous Agent
```cx
using textGen from "Cx.AI.TextGeneration";
using embeddings from "Cx.AI.TextEmbeddings";

// Agent responds to environmental stimuli
on "user.message" (payload)
{
    // Structured AI response for reliable processing
    var sentiment = textGen.GenerateAsync(
        "Rate sentiment 1-10 (1=negative, 10=positive). Respond only with number:",
        payload.content
    );
    
    var intent = textGen.GenerateAsync(
        "Classify intent as: question, command, greeting, complaint, or other",
        payload.content
    );
    
    // Semantic similarity for nuanced pattern detection
    var urgencyEmbedding = embeddings.GenerateEmbeddingAsync("urgent emergency help critical");
    var contentEmbedding = embeddings.GenerateEmbeddingAsync(payload.content);
    var urgencyLevel = embeddings.CalculateSimilarity(contentEmbedding, urgencyEmbedding);
    
    when (urgencyLevel > 0.8)
    {
        emit "priority.urgent", {
            content: payload.content,
            sentiment: sentiment,
            intent: intent,
            urgencyScore: urgencyLevel
        };
    }
}
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```cx
class DebateAgent
{
    perspective: string;
    constructor(p) { this.perspective = p; }
    
    function argue(topic)
    {
        return textGen.GenerateAsync(
            "Argue about " + topic + " from the perspective of " + this.perspective
        );
    }
}

var agents = [
    new DebateAgent("a climate scientist"),
    new DebateAgent("an industrial CEO"), 
    new DebateAgent("a policy maker"),
    new DebateAgent("a citizen activist")
];

// Run all agents concurrently
parallel for (agent in agents)
{
    var argument = agent.argue("renewable energy transition");
    emit "debate.position", {
        perspective: agent.perspective,
        argument: argument
    };
}
```
