🧬 Perspective: Passionate climate scientist focused on environmental action
```

### 2. Prof. Smith - The Environmental Economist
```  
🎭 Voice Profile: Calm-Analytical
🐌 Speech Rate: Measured-Slow

```

### 3. Maya - The Environmental Activist
```
🎭 Voice Profile: Youthful-Energetic  
🚶 Speech Rate: Medium-Paced
🔥 Emotional Tone: Passionate
✊ Perspective: Energetic environmental activist fighting for justice
```

## 🚀 Demo Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Agent Creation & Voice Introduction
Each agent introduces themselves with their unique voice personality:

```
🎭 Creating Dr. Green with authoritative-scientific voice (urgent tone)
🗣️ Dr. Green says: Hello, I am Dr. Green, a passionate climate scientist. I speak with urgent conviction.
🔊 [authoritative-scientific voice at fast-paced speed]: Hello, I am Dr. Green...

🎭 Creating Prof. Smith with calm-analytical voice (contemplative tone)
🗣️ Prof. Smith says: Hello, I am Prof. Smith, a thoughtful environmental economist. I speak with contemplative conviction.
🔊 [calm-analytical voice at measured-slow speed]: Hello, I am Prof. Smith...

🎭 Creating Maya with youthful-energetic voice (passionate tone)
🗣️ Maya says: Hello, I am Maya, an energetic environmental activist. I speak with passionate conviction.
🔊 [youthful-energetic voice at medium-paced speed]: Hello, I am Maya...
```

### Phase 2: Structured Debate Rounds
- **Round 1**: Opening statements with distinct voice tones
- **Round 2**: Cross-responses with emotional voice variations
- **Coordination**: Turn-based speaking with voice personality maintenance

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Voice Personality System
```cx
class DebateAgent
{
    name: string;              // Agent identity
    perspective: string;       // Debate viewpoint
    voiceStyle: string;        // Voice character (scientific/analytical/energetic)
    speechRate: string;        // Speaking pace (fast/slow/medium)
    emotionalTone: string;     // Emotional expression (urgent/contemplative/passionate)
    textGenService: object;    // AI text generation service
    ttsService: object;        // Text-to-speech synthesis service
}
```

### Multi-Service Injection
```cx
var agent = new DebateAgent(
    "Dr. Green",                    // Name
    "passionate climate scientist", // Perspective  
    "authoritative-scientific",     // Voice style
    "fast-paced",                  // Speech rate
    "urgent",                      // Emotional tone
    textGen,                       // Text generation service
    tts                           // Speech synthesis service
);
```

### Dynamic Method Orchestration
```cx
function speak(message)
{
    print("💬 " + this.name + " (" + this.emotionalTone + " tone): " + message);
    print("🔊 [" + this.voiceStyle + " voice, " + this.speechRate + " pace]: " + message);
    // Real speech synthesis: this.ttsService.SpeakAsync(message);
    return message;
}
```

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Demo

### Prerequisites
1. CX Language runtime environment
2. Azure OpenAI services configured
