# CX Wiki Syntax Corrections Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive syntax corrections applied to all CX wiki documentation files to ensure proper usage of event-driven architecture keywords.

## Critical Syntax Rules Enforced

### 1. `when` Keyword Usage
- **CORRECT**: `when` is only usable inside `on` event receiver blocks
- **INCORRECT**: Using `when` in regular functions or standalone code (must use `if` instead)

### 2. `on` Keyword Behavior
- **Purpose**: Defines event receiver functions that listen for events on the event bus
- **Scope**: Can be defined globally or within class instances
- **Behavior**: Each class instance can have its own event receivers

### 3. `emit` Keyword
- **Scope**: **Globally available** throughout the codebase - can be used anywhere
- **Purpose**: Publish events to the event bus for other agents to process
- **Usage**: Valid in functions, classes, event handlers, and standalone code

### 4. `if` Keyword
- **Scope**: Used for regular conditional logic everywhere except inside `on` blocks
- **Purpose**: Standard conditional statements for functions and general code
- **Event Handlers**: Inside `on` blocks, prefer `when` for conditional logic

## Files Corrected

### ✅ Autonomous-Programming-Best-Practices.md
**Corrections Applied:**
- Fixed `getResponseParameters()` function: `when` → `if`
- Fixed `processExperience()` function: `when` → `if`  
- Fixed `adaptStrategy()` function: `when` → `if`
- Fixed `adjustStrategy()` function: `when` → `if`
- Fixed `primaryProcessing()` function: `when` → `if`
- Fixed `handleAutonomousError()` function: `when` → `if`
- Fixed `processEfficiently()` function: `when` → `if`
- Fixed `getCachedEmbedding()` function: `when` → `if`
- Fixed `generateTestReport()` function: `when` → `if`

**Preserved Correct Usage:**
- All `when` statements inside `on "perception.analyzed"` event handler remained unchanged
- All `when` statements inside other event receiver blocks remained unchanged

### ✅ Semantic-Similarity-Patterns.md  
**Corrections Applied:**
- Fixed `classifyContent()` function loop: `when` → `if`
- Fixed `analyzeUrgency()` function: `when` → `if`
- Fixed usage example in documentation: `when` → `if`
- Fixed `isDuplicate()` function: `when` → `if`
- Fixed `validateAndClassify()` function: `when` → `if`

**Preserved Correct Usage:**
- All `when` statements inside event handler blocks remained unchanged
- Event-driven examples correctly using `when` within `on` blocks

### ✅ Event-Driven-Architecture.md
**Enhancement Applied:**
- Added comprehensive documentation for class-level event receivers
- Clarified that `on` keyword can define event receivers both globally and within class instances
- Added detailed examples showing instance-level event handling

**No Corrections Needed:**
- All existing `when` usage was already correct (inside `on` blocks)
- All examples properly demonstrated event-driven architecture

### ✅ Home.md
**No Corrections Needed:**
- All `when` usage was already correct (inside `on` blocks)
- Examples properly demonstrated event-driven patterns

### ✅ AI-Services-Overview.md
**No Corrections Needed:**
- No event-driven code examples present
- All content focused on AI service documentation

## Validation Results

### ✅ Syntax Rules Properly Applied
1. **`when` keyword**: Only used inside `on` event receiver blocks
2. **`if` keyword**: Used in all regular function conditionals
3. **`on` keyword**: Properly documented as event receiver definition
4. **`emit` keyword**: Correctly used globally for event publishing

### ✅ Event-Driven Architecture Preserved
- All event handler logic maintained correct `when` usage
- Event emission patterns preserved throughout examples
- Multi-agent coordination examples properly structured

### ✅ Class-Level Event Receivers Documented
- Added comprehensive examples of instance-level `on` blocks
- Demonstrated how different class instances can have their own event receivers
- Clarified that `on` defines event receiver functions, not just global handlers

## Impact Assessment

### Educational Accuracy
- ✅ Wiki now teaches correct CX syntax patterns
- ✅ Developers will learn proper event-driven architecture usage
- ✅ Examples demonstrate real autonomous programming patterns

### Codebase Consistency  
- ✅ All documentation aligns with CX language specifications
- ✅ Event-driven architecture properly represented
- ✅ Autonomous programming patterns correctly illustrated

### Development Guidance
- ✅ Clear distinction between `when` (event-driven) and `if` (regular conditionals)
- ✅ Proper understanding of `on` keyword as event receiver definition
- ✅ Accurate representation of class-level event handling capabilities

## Future Maintenance
- **Principle**: Always validate that `when` is only used inside `on` blocks
- **Testing**: Verify event-driven examples against actual CX compiler behavior
- **Updates**: Ensure new documentation follows established syntax rules

---

**Result**: Complete wiki documentation now accurately reflects CX language event-driven architecture with proper keyword usage throughout all examples and code patterns.
