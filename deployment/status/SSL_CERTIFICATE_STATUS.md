# üîí SSL Certificate Status - Expected Behavior

## ‚úÖ GOOD NEWS: Your DNS is Working!

The SSL certificate error you're seeing is **EXPECTED** and means:

### What's Happening:
- ‚úÖ **DNS is configured correctly** (www.agilecloud.ai resolves)
- ‚úÖ **Website is accessible** (you can reach it)
- ‚è≥ **SSL certificate is still provisioning** (takes up to 6 hours)

### The Error Explained:
```
"This server couldn't prove that it's www.agilecloud.ai; 
its security certificate is from *.azureedge.net"
```

This means:
- Azure CDN is serving your website correctly
- But the SSL certificate for your custom domain isn't ready yet
- It's still using the default Azure CDN certificate

### Timeline for SSL Certificate:
- **DNS Setup**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (working now)
- **Certificate Request**: ‚è≥ In progress (automatic)
- **Certificate Provisioning**: 1-6 hours from DNS setup
- **HTTPS Ready**: Will work automatically once provisioned

### Current Status:
```
‚úÖ http://www.agilecloud.ai - Works (no SSL needed)
‚è≥ https://www.agilecloud.ai - SSL certificate provisioning
‚úÖ http://agilecloud.ai - Should work if A record added
‚è≥ https://agilecloud.ai - SSL certificate provisioning
```

### How to Test Safely:
1. **HTTP (no SSL)**: http://www.agilecloud.ai - Should work now
2. **Wait for HTTPS**: Check back in 2-6 hours for SSL
3. **Verify script**: Run `.\verify-dns.ps1` to monitor status

### When HTTPS Will Work:
Azure automatically provisions Let's Encrypt certificates for custom domains. This process:
- Starts after DNS is configured
- Takes 1-6 hours to complete
- Happens automatically (no action needed)
- Will enable https://agilecloud.ai and https://www.agilecloud.ai

## üéâ Success! Your domain is working - just waiting for SSL certificates to finish provisioning.

**Next Check**: Try again in 2-4 hours for full HTTPS support.
