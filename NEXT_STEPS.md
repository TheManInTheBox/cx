agent1.position = "Renewable Energy Advocate";  // Field assignment working
var argument = textGen.GenerateAsync("Generate climate argument from " + agent1.name);
tts.SpeakAsync(agent1.name + " argues: " + argument);  // Voice synthesis working

// Regular objects without event bus overhead  
var data = new DataClass();
