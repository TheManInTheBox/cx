## About

Software architect and researcher developing CX Language, an experimental programming platform exploring consciousness-driven computation. My work focuses on event-driven architectures and AI service integration patterns.

**Research Achievements:**
• Built working local LLM integration using GGUF models (2GB Llama execution verified)
• Developed interactive AI agents capable of mathematical problem-solving (23+23 with step-by-step solutions)
• Created real IL compilation pipelines generating .NET bytecode from custom syntax
• Implemented complete event bus architecture with property access patterns
• Integrated Azure OpenAI Realtime API for voice processing applications
• Designed cognitive boolean logic patterns eliminating traditional if-statements

**Technical Focus:**
Event-driven programming, AI service orchestration, real-time voice processing, and .NET IL generation. Currently exploring how programming languages can evolve to better support AI-driven decision making.

Open to collaborating on innovative programming language research and AI integration patterns.
