Cx
==
A scripting language for fun and profit.

``` cpp
use io;

io.puts("Hello, World!");

return 0;
```

### Supported compilers and platforms
Popular compilers which support C++11 are used to build the Cx interpreter.

* clang++
* g++4.7 or later
* VS 2012 express

Cx language features are restricted to the C++11 standard library and will compile on OSX, Linux, and Windows. Any features deemed platform specific will be implemented in dynamic libraries which can be loaded at run-time.

### Cx Documentation
All documentation will be posted and updated at the link below. More information may be found in Cx/doc
