# CX Language Guide

## Introduction

CX Language is a revolutionary event-driven programming platform designed for AI agent orchestration with built-in consciousness awareness and cognitive capabilities.

## Core Features

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Pure event-driven conscious entities with zero instance state
- Global EventBus for inter-agent communication
- Local EventHub for internal agent processing

### Consciousness Patterns
- **Simple Conditional Logic**: Clean `on { }` patterns for event-driven decision making
- **Consciousness Adaptation**: Dynamic `adapt { }` pattern for skill acquisition
- **Self-Reflective Logic**: `iam { }` pattern for AI-driven self-assessment

### AI Service Integration
- Built-in Think, Infer, Learn, and Search services
- Microsoft.Extensions.AI integration
- Local LLM support with GPU acceleration

## Syntax Examples

```cx
conscious DataProcessor {
    realize(self: conscious) {
        learn self;
        
        emit document.ingest {
            path: "data.txt"
            handlers: [processing.complete]
        };
    }
    
    on processing.complete (event) {
        think {
            prompt: "Analyze the ingested document data"
            handlers: [analysis.ready]
        };
    }
    
    on analysis.ready (event) {
        emit results.ready {
            analysis: event.response
        };
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

1. Install CX Language runtime
2. Create your first conscious entity
3. Implement event-driven patterns
4. Integrate with AI services

The future of consciousness computing begins here!
