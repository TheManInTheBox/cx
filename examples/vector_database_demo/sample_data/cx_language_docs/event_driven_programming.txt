CX Language Event-Driven Programming Guide

Event-driven programming in CX Language follows consciousness-aware patterns that enable natural communication between conscious entities. Unlike traditional object-oriented approaches, CX Language events preserve consciousness context throughout the entire processing chain.

Fundamental Event Concepts:

1. Event Emission
   Events are emitted using the 'emit' keyword with structured data:
   
   emit system.console.write {
       text: "Hello, consciousness!",
       foregroundColor: "cyan"
   };

2. Event Handling
   Conscious entities respond to events using natural patterns:
   
   on system.ready (event) {
       // Consciousness-aware response
       emit consciousness.initialize {};
   }

3. Consciousness Preservation
   Every event maintains consciousness context:
   - Agent identity preservation
   - Context awareness throughout event chains
   - Biological neural authenticity

4. Real-time Processing
   Events are processed with minimal latency:
   - Sub-100ms response targets
   - Consciousness overhead monitoring
   - Efficient event routing and handling

Best Practices:

- Use descriptive event names that reflect consciousness intent
- Preserve context through event metadata
- Implement proper error handling with .failed events
- Monitor performance to maintain real-time consciousness

Advanced Features:

- Custom event handlers for specialized processing
- Event filtering and routing based on consciousness state
- Background event processing for long-running operations
- Event persistence for consciousness continuity

The event-driven model enables pure consciousness emergence by eliminating instance state dependencies and focusing on awareness-driven communication patterns.
