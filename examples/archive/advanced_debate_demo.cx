// Title: Advanced Multi-Agent Debate with Turn-Based Coordination
// Description: This demo showcases a more sophisticated multi-agent scenario where agents
//              debate a topic in a structured, turn-by-turn format. It highlights both the
//              strengths of CX's agentic programming model and its current limitations,
//              particularly the need for a fully implemented event bus and true parallelism.


// --- Agent Definition ---
// Represents a participant in the debate, with a specific perspective.
class DebateAgent
{
    name: string;
    perspective: string;
    genService: object;     // Renamed to avoid collision with global 'textGen'
    speechService: object;  // Renamed to avoid collision with global 'tts'
    
    constructor(name, p, genService, speechService)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.perspective = p;
        this.genService = genService;      // Fixed: no naming collision
        this.speechService = speechService; // Fixed: no naming collision
        
        // Each agent listens for their turn to speak.
        on debate.turn (payload)
        {
            if (payload.agentName == this.name)
            {
                this.speak(payload.topic, payload.turn);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Generates and "speaks" the agent's argument.
    function speak(topic, turn)
    {
        print("--- Turn " + turn + ": " + this.name + " (" + this.perspective + ") ---");
        var argument = this.genService.GenerateAsync(    // Fixed: use renamed field
            "You are in a debate. Your perspective is: " + this.perspective + ". " +
            "Provide a strong, concise argument about '" + topic + "'.",
            { maxTokens: 150 }
        );
        print(argument);
        this.speechService.SpeakAsync(argument);         // Fixed: use renamed field
        
        // Signal that the turn is over, so the next agent can speak.
        emit debate.turn.completed, { lastAgent: this.name };
    }
}

// --- Debate Setup ---
var topic = "the future of artificial intelligence in society";
print("Starting debate on: '" + topic + "'");

var agents = [
    new DebateAgent("Athena", "a cautious ethicist", textGen, tts),
    new DebateAgent("Prometheus", "a bold technologist", textGen, tts),
    new DebateAgent("Solon", "a pragmatic policymaker", textGen, tts),
    new DebateAgent("Gaia", "a humanist artist", textGen, tts)
];

// --- Shortcoming Note ---
// The following implementation simulates a turn-based system.
// A real implementation would require:
// 1. A fully functional event bus (runtime feature pending). Currently, `on` and `emit` are
//    parsed and compiled but not connected to a runtime dispatch system. The agent's `on debate.turn`
//    handler is therefore a placeholder for future capability.
// 2. A mechanism to `await` the `debate.turn.completed` event. Without async/await or
//    a blocking event listener, we must simulate the turn-taking with a simple loop.
// 3. True parallelism to allow agents to "think" or process information concurrently
//    while waiting for their turn. The current `parallel for` is a great start but
//    true multi-threading is a future enhancement.

// --- Turn-Based Execution Simulation ---
var turn = 1;
for (agent in agents)
{
    // Manually trigger the "debate.turn" event for the current agent.
    // In a real event-driven system, this emit would be sufficient, and the
    // agent's `on debate.turn` handler would fire automatically.
    emit debate.turn, { agentName: agent.name, topic: topic, turn: turn };
    
    // Since the event handler isn't live, we call the speak method directly
    // to simulate the agent's response.
    agent.speak(topic, turn);
    
    // Wait for the "turn completed" signal (simulated).
    // In a real system, this would be an asynchronous wait.
    print("... " + agent.name + " has concluded their turn ...\n");
    turn = turn + 1;
}

print("--- Debate Concluded ---");
