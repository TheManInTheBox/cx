/* Global scope is limited to the first few lines
 * of the script.
 *
 * A global scope is force by inserting the
 * compound operator before generating icode, and
 * inserting a call to main() after global scope is left.
 *
 * Kind of sloppy, but works. The only limitation is
 * globals must be at the top of the script file.
 * Maybe good for forcing global code organization??
 *
 * time to finish other statements and types :)
