# CX Agent Integration - Autonomous Programming Platform

## Overview
CX (Cognitive Executor) is designed as an autonomous programming platform where AI agents, including GitHub Copilot, can execute code directly for autonomous programming tasks. Built on the Aura cognitive architecture framework.

## Agent Integration Capabilities

### GitHub Copilot as CX Agent
- **Direct Execution**: Copilot can write and execute CX code in real-time
- **Autonomous Task Completion**: Handle complex programming tasks independently
- **Code Generation & Execution**: Dynamic creation and immediate execution of solutions
- **Multi-Step Workflows**: Chain multiple CX operations for complex tasks

### Autonomous Programming Examples

### **1. Aura: Event-Driven Sensory Agent**
This example showcases sophisticated autonomous programming with structured AI responses and semantic decision-making. Demonstrates proper prompt engineering and AI-powered event processing.

```cx
using textGen from "Cx.AI.TextGeneration";
using vectorDb from "Cx.AI.VectorDatabase";
using embeddings from "Cx.AI.TextEmbeddings";

// Agent 1: Structured AI Analysis with Reliable Output
on audio.transcribed (payload)  // ✅ Unquoted event names
{
    // CX Best Practice: Structured AI responses for reliable processing
    var intentClassification = textGen.GenerateAsync(
        "Analyze the user intent. Respond with ONLY one word: query, command, greeting, complaint, or other",
        payload.content
    );
    
    var sentimentScore = textGen.GenerateAsync(
        "Rate sentiment from 1-10 (1=very negative, 10=very positive). Respond with only the number:",
        payload.content
    );

    // Cx emits structured, processable data
    emit presence.signal, {  // ✅ Unquoted event names
        source: "audio", 
        intent: intentClassification,
        sentiment: sentimentScore,
        originalContent: payload.content
    };
}

// Agent 2: AI-Powered Decision Making with Semantic Understanding
on presence.signal (payload)  // ✅ Unquoted event names
{
    // CX Best Practice: AI-powered conditional logic
    var isQuestionIntent = textGen.GenerateAsync(
        "Is this intent asking for information or help? Answer only: YES or NO",
        payload.intent
    );
    
    if (isQuestionIntent == "YES")  // ✅ Simplified: 'if' everywhere
    {
        // CX Best Practice: Context-aware AI reasoning
        var response = textGen.GenerateAsync(
            "Generate a helpful response to: " + payload.originalContent + 
            ". User sentiment level is " + payload.sentiment + "/10",
            {
                temperature: 0.7,
                maxTokens: 150
            }
        );
        
        emit cognition.response, {  // ✅ Unquoted event names
            response: response,
            confidence: "high",
            processingAgent: "query-handler"
        };
    }
    
    // CX Best Practice: Semantic similarity for nuanced matching
    var contentEmbedding = embeddings.GenerateEmbeddingAsync(payload.originalContent);
    var urgencyEmbedding = embeddings.GenerateEmbeddingAsync("urgent important help emergency");
    var urgencyScore = embeddings.CalculateSimilarity(contentEmbedding, urgencyEmbedding);
    
    if (urgencyScore > 0.8)  // ✅ Simplified: 'if' everywhere
    {
        emit system.alert, {  // ✅ Unquoted event names
            level: "high",
            reason: "High urgency content detected",
            content: payload.originalContent,
            urgencyScore: urgencyScore
        };
    }
}
```

### **2. Cx: Parallel Multi-Agent Coordination**
This demonstrates true multi-agent autonomy. Four different AI agents are instantiated and run in parallel to debate a topic from their unique perspectives, showcasing the `parallel` keyword.

```cx
using textGen from "Cx.AI.TextGeneration";

class DebateAgent
{
    perspective: string;
    constructor(p) { this.perspective = p; }
    function argue(topic)
    {
        return textGen.GenerateAsync("Argue about " + topic + " from the perspective of " + this.perspective);
    }
}

var agents = [
    new DebateAgent("a climate scientist"),
    new DebateAgent("an industrial CEO"),
    new DebateAgent("a policy maker"),
    new DebateAgent("a citizen activist")
];

// Run all agents concurrently
parallel for (agent in agents)
{
    var argument = agent.argue("climate change");
    print(agent.perspective + ": " + argument);
}
```

### **3. Integrated AI: RAG & Multi-Modal Workflow**
This example highlights the seamless integration of CX's most advanced AI services, combining Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-modal image generation.

```cx
using vectorDb from "Cx.AI.VectorDatabase";
using imageGen from "Cx.AI.ImageGeneration";

// 1. Ingest knowledge into the vector database
vectorDb.IngestTextAsync("The CX language enables agents to achieve autonomy through an event-driven architecture called Aura.");

// 2. Use RAG to ask a question against the knowledge
var context = vectorDb.AskAsync("How do agents achieve autonomy in CX?");

// 3. Use the retrieved context to generate a relevant image
var image = imageGen.GenerateAsync("A visual representation of: " + context, {
    quality: "hd",
    size: "1024x1024"
});

print("Generated image based on retrieved context: " + image);
```
