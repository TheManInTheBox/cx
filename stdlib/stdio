/* Cx library to perform Input/Output operations

 * desc     : Input/Output operations
 *
 * This library uses what are called streams to operate with physical devices
 * such as keyboards, printers, terminals or with any other type of files
 * supported by the system. Streams are an abstraction to interact with these
 * in an uniform way; All streams have similar properties independently of the
 * individual characteristics of the physical media they are associated with.
 *
 * Streams are handled in the (C++) cstdio library as pointers to FILE objects.
 * A pointer to a FILE object uniquely identifies a stream, and is used as a
 * parameter in the operations involving that stream.
 *
 * There also exist three standard streams: stdin, stdout and
 * stderr, which are automatically created and opened for all programs
 * using the library.
