/* Cx library to perform Input/Output operations

 * desc     : Input/Output operations
 *
 * This library uses what are called streams to operate with physical devices
 * such as keyboards, printers, terminals or with any other type of files
 * supported by the system. Streams are an abstraction to interact with these
 * in an uniform way; All streams have similar properties independently of the
 * individual characteristics of the physical media they are associated with.
 *
 * Streams are handled in the (C++) cstdio library as pointers to FILE objects.
 * A pointer to a FILE object uniquely identifies a stream, and is used as a
 * parameter in the operations involving that stream.
 *
 * There also exist three standard streams: stdin, stdout and
 * stderr, which are automatically created and opened for all programs
 * using the library.

/* putc - Write character to stream
 * Writes a character to the stream and advances the position indicator.
 *
 * The character is written at the position indicated by the internal
 * position indicator of the stream, which is then automatically
 * advanced by one.
 *
 * @param c      : character to write as 'char' type.
 * @param stream : reference to a FILE object that identifies an output stream.
 * @return ASCII code of character written. */

/* putchar - Write character to stdout
 * Writes a character to the standard output (stdout).
 *
 * It is equivalent to calling putc with stdout as second argument.
 *
 * @param c : character to write to stdout.
 * @return ASCII code of character written. */

/* puts - Write string to stdout
 * Writes the copied Cx string 'str' to the standard output (stdout)
 *
 * The function calls 'putchar' from the address specified (str[]) until it reaches
 * the terminating null character ('\0'). This terminating null-character is not
 * copied to the stream.
 *
 * @param str : copied char array to write to stdout.
 * @return the string length of str. */

 * and sets the end-of-file indicator for the stream (feof).

 * A terminating null character is automatically appended after the characters
 * copied to str.
