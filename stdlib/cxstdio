/* Cx library to perform Input/Output operations
 *
 * file     : cxstdio
 * author   : <aaron.hebert@gmail.com>
 * desc     : Input/Output operations
 *
 * This library uses what are called streams to operate with physical devices 
 * such as keyboards, printers, terminals or with any other type of files 
 * supported by the system. Streams are an abstraction to interact with these 
 * in an uniform way; All streams have similar properties independently of the 
 * individual characteristics of the physical media they are associated with.
 *
 * Streams are handled in the (C++) cstdio library as pointers to FILE objects. 
 * A pointer to a FILE object uniquely identifies a stream, and is used as a 
 * parameter in the operations involving that stream.
 *
 * There also exist three standard streams: stdin, stdout and 
 * stderr, which are automatically created and opened for all programs 
 * using the library.
