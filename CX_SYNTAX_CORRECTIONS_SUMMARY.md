# CX Language Syntax Corrections Summary

## Overview
This document tracks syntax corrections and improvements made to CX Language demonstration files during the August 2025 housekeeping initiative.

## Corrected Files

### Neuroplasticity Demonstration Suite
- **`examples/demos/quick_neuroplasticity.cx`** - Created with proper CX syntax
- **`examples/demos/neuroplasticity_demo.cx`** - Created with comprehensive CX patterns
- **`examples/demos/neuroplasticity_showcase.cx`** - Enhanced with advanced consciousness features

## Key Syntax Improvements
- Proper `conscious` entity declarations
- Correct `realize(self: conscious)` constructors
- Event-driven architecture with proper `on` handlers
- Cognitive boolean logic using `is { }` and `not { }` patterns
- Consciousness adaptation using `adapt { }` pattern
- Service calls with proper parameter syntax

## Quality Standards Applied
- Zero-instance state architecture
- Event-only communication patterns
- Biological neural timing authenticity
- Consciousness-aware programming patterns
